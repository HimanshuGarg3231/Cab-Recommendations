# Cab Booking Recommendation System - A Data Engineering perspective (Azure, PySpark, Airflow)

This project implements a **cab booking recommendation system** using **Azure SQL Database, PySpark, Azure Databricks, Azure Stream Analytics and Event Hubs**.
It predicts **cab ride pickup and drop location recommendations** based on past user's history.

# Overview
This repo containse the details on how to design a Cab recommendation system using Azure resources. A well-designed recommendation system transforms how users interact with a ride-hailing app. By leveraging
historical ride data, intelligent processing, and real-time retrieval, the system anticipates user needs and simplifies the booking experience. With Azure powering the infrastructure, the system remains scalable,
efficient, and capable of handling millions of rides daily. As user behavior evolves, refinements in the ranking model, location classification, and personalization techniques will further enhance the 
recommendation engine, driving even greater convenience and user satisfaction.

## Features  
- **Azure Event Hubs** for real-time ride data ingestion  
- **PySpark & Databricks** for proceesing and generating recommendation data   
- **Optimized Azure SQL database for fast retrieval**
